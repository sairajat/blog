**Summary:**  
Ever had your CUDA kernels mysteriously hang, even though everything *looked* fine? You're not alone. This post walks through a deceptively simple code snippet that deadlocks — and explains how **lazy loading**, **asynchronous streams**, and **cold GPUs** all conspire to make benchmarking and debugging... interesting. We'll break down what happens, why it matters, and how to keep your GPU pipelines warm and humming.

## 💥 The Problem: A Hanging CUDA Program

Let’s jump straight into the puzzle. Here's a CUDA C++ program that may either hang or complete depending on which kernel variant you choose:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

__device__ volatile int s = 0;

__global__ void k1(){
  while (s == 0) {};
}

__global__ void k2(){
  s = 1;
}

__global__ void k(int x) {
  if (x == 0) {
    while (s == 0) {};
  } else {
    s = 1;
  }
}

int main() {
  cudaStream_t s1, s2;
  cudaStreamCreate(&s1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&s2);
#if 1 //!!!hang
  k1<<<1,1,0,s1>>>();
  k2<<<1,1,0,s2>>>();
#else // works
  k<<<1,1,0,s1>>>(0);
  k<<<1,1,0,s2>>>(1);
#endif
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
  if (err != cudaSuccess)
    std::cout << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
}
```

## 🧪 What's Going On?

Let’s break it down:

- `k1` is a kernel that spins in a loop until `s == 1`.
- `k2` sets `s = 1`.
- Both are launched in *different streams* (`s1` and `s2`), so they can execute concurrently.

But here’s the twist: **this code hangs in the first case, but not in the second.**

Why? Because of **lazy kernel loading**.

## 🐢 Lazy Loading: CUDA's Optimization Trick

By default, CUDA uses **lazy loading** (`CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=LAZY`). This means:

- Kernels aren't actually loaded onto the GPU until *just before they run*.
- *Loading kernels might require context synchronization* - If a kernel is blocked (e.g., `k1` is spinning forever waiting on `s`), it may **never yield**, so `k2`’s module never gets loaded.
- Result: `k2` never executes → `s` never becomes `1` → `k1` spins forever → 💀 deadlock.

### ✅ Fix It: Set Module Loading to Eager

To avoid this, set:

```bash
export CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER
```

This loads all kernels *up front*, ensuring both `k1` and `k2` are resident on the GPU before either begins execution.

## 🔥 Why Warmups Matter: The Hidden Complexity of GPU Power States

The module loading behavior isn’t the only reason to **warm up** your GPU before benchmarking. There's a deeper, more **hardware-level** reason involving GPU **power states**.

Here’s what happens when your GPU has been sitting idle:

- It enters a **low-power state** — sometimes almost completely powered down.
- Components like the memory subsystem, caches, clocks, and even compute cores may be shut off.
- Bringing the GPU back up is a **complex orchestration**:
  - Power up voltage rails
  - Wake up clock generators
  - Initialize memory controllers, pin drivers, DRAM
  - Perform ECC scrub (initialize memory with ECC tags)

This process takes time — *seconds in some cases*. So your first CUDA call isn’t benchmarking your kernel; it’s measuring **hardware wake-up time**.

### 👁️ How to Observe Power States
- Use `nvidia-smi` to see GPU power state (`P0` = max performance, `P8` = idle).
- **Warning:** Running `nvidia-smi` itself may *change* the power state. Sneaky.

## 🧠 Other Reasons to Warm Up Your Kernels

1. **JIT Compilation**: CUDA may compile kernels on-the-fly the first time you call them.
2. **Page Faults**: Unified memory may need to fault and allocate actual device memory.
3. **Memory Pooling**: Allocators may initialize memory pools only after the first allocation.
4. **Clock Boosting**: GPU frequency scaling may take a few seconds to reach peak clock.

## 💡 Best Practices for Benchmarking

- Always run a few dummy kernel launches before recording performance.
- Explicitly set `CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER` for critical benchmarking.
- Use `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` after warmups to make sure everything is fully initialized.
- Pin memory ahead of time to avoid host-to-device delays on first transfer.

## 🎯 Conclusion

That innocent-looking `while (s == 0)` loop just taught us some deep truths:

- CUDA uses **lazy loading** that can lead to hangs if you're not careful.
- GPUs sleep — and waking them up is not instant coffee.
- Benchmarking isn't just about timing kernels; it’s about ensuring a consistent environment.

So next time your kernel runs “slow” the first time, don’t blame the compiler — it might just be your GPU stretching and yawning after a nap. 😴
